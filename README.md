# MATLAB_Scientific_Calculator
Calculator developed using MATLAB 
# MATLAB GUI-Based Scientific Calculator

This project is a **GUI-based Scientific Calculator** developed using **MATLAB App Designer** during my **MATLAB Internship**.  
It allows users to perform both **basic arithmetic** and **advanced scientific operations** with a clean, interactive interface. All trigonometric calculations (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`) are implemented in **degrees**, making it intuitive for engineering and scientific purposes.

## 🔹 Features

### **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`×`)
- Division (`÷`)

### **Scientific Functions**
- Power (`xʸ`)
- Sine (`sin(θ)` in degrees)
- Cosine (`cos(θ)` in degrees)
- Tangent (`tan(θ)` in degrees)
- Logarithm (`log(x)`)

### **Other Key Features**
- Interactive **GUI interface** with buttons and display
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero)
- Modular design using MATLAB functions for each operation
- Easy to extend for additional operations in future
